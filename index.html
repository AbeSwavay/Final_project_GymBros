        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Gym Bros</strong>—where passion, strength, and community come together! Our story began with a small group of friends who simply loved to work out, push each other, and celebrate every victory, big or small. What started as a garage gym quickly grew into a thriving family of fitness enthusiasts from all walks of life. At Gym Bros, we believe in more than just lifting weights—we believe in lifting each other up.
        </p>

          Our gym is built on the foundation of friendship, encouragement, and relentless hype. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or just starting your fitness journey, you’ll find a home here. We’re not just a gym—we’re a family that sweats together, laughs together, and grows stronger together. Every member is welcomed with open arms and a high five!

          We're proud of our roots and the community we've built. Our coaches are passionate, our members are supportive, and our energy is unmatched. From sunrise bootcamps to late-night lifting sessions, there’s always someone here to cheer you on. We host epic challenges, celebrate every milestone, and make sure every workout is an experience you’ll never forget.
